Stripe Snoop Change Log
http://stripesnoop.sourceforge.net

   - Near complete re-write of code! Object Oriented Madness! Makes
     support for new readers, new tracks, new cards, etc MUCH
     easier. : Acidus
   - Mac OS X, BSD, and non 86 platform support added: Acidus
   - Code auto-detects compiling platform, and will added
     appropriate code for hardware interfaces (ie #defines
     no longer used): Acidus
   - Code has been divided into more source files, to better
     match concept abstractions, aid maintenance.: Acidus
   - Sound Blaster Live! under Linux, Windows now working.: Acidus
   - Alpha Decoding and more flexible BCD decoding : Mentat
   - Beginning of looping implementation "-l" : Mentat
   - rdetect auto detects reader type, writes config file. : Acidus
   - Configuration file is XML. Uses SXMLP (Small XML Parser),
     written custom for SS. : Acidus
   - Auto detection of character set used on a track : Acidus
   - Serial Based readers supported : Acidus
   - DOS Support fully Dropped : Acidus

   Cards Added
	Old California Drivers License : Mentat
	Mastercard w/ basic database : Mentat
	Discover Card : Mentat
	Airline	Boarding Passes : Acidus
	Airline Tickets : Acidus
   
Version 1.5 (8-8-2004)

   - Force parse (-F) will now parse characters that don't pass parity: Acidus
   - Added formatting function to make Account numbers follow : Acidus
     format on the card. : Acidus
   - Streamlined the database lookup process : Acidus
   - Added Card Notes to database entries : Acidus
   - Filled in all the missing comments and prototypes in source code : Acidus
   - Formatted tabs to line up when printing report : Acidus
   - Added entry of unknowns about each card type, to get people : Acidus
     to submit data and help out : Acidus

   Cards Added 

     American Express Blue Card : Acidus
     Barnes & Noble Reader's Advantage Card : Acidus
     British Petroleum (BP) Gasoline Card : Acidus
     Delta Crown Room Club Card : Acidus
     Home Depot Consumer Credit Card : Acidus
     Neiman Marcus Charge Card : Acidus
     Radisson Gold Rewards Card : Acidus
     COSTCO Business Membership Card : Acidus
     US Air Frequent Traveler Card : Acidus
     Walden Books Reader Card : Acidus
     AAMVA Compliant North American Driver's License : Acidus

Version 1.4 (8-6-2004)

   - Added Force parse (-F) which tries to parse a bit stream as
     long as it has at least a start character : Acidus
   - Limited Cherry Keyboard (and other readers that connect
     through the keyboard) support added. Works best with cards
     containing only 1 track. : Acidus
   - Added more Issuing Bank names for Visa : Acidus
   - Code simplification: Lookup tables, single line ifs with ?'s : Acidus
   - bitgen ignores ";" and "?" : Acidus
   - Track 1 and Track 2 Support with Cherry Keyboards, though only
     Track 2 will be parsed. : Acidus
   - mod10 will generate Luhn compliant account numbers of any
     length : Acidus

   Cards Added

     American Express Credit Card : Acidus
     Barnes & Noble Gift Card : Acidus
     Generic ATM Cards : Acidus
     Georgia Institute of Technology Parking or Temporary Card : Acidus

Version 1.3 (7-17-2004)

   - Added Raw mode (-r) to display the raw binary of a track. : Acidus
   - Now parsing command line options with getopt-like code. : Acidus
   - Windows directory added with Project and Workspace files
     to make Windows development easier. : Acidus
   - Makefile added to make Linux/DOS development easier. : Acidus
   - Hardware plans and documents have been added to a directory
     called "hardware" : Acidus
   - Added Input mode (-i) where a bit stream of 1's and 0's from
     stdin is passed through the parsing engine. Allows for card
     research to be done without a card reader! : Acidus
   - Issuing Bank Names are reported based on CC Prefix. : Acidus
   - bitgen, a command line tool to generate valid Track 2 
     bit streams was added. Used with Input mode to allow
     meaningful functionality to users without reader hardware. : Acidus
   - DOS support has been dropped (briefly) while I find a better
     compiler than Turbo C++ 1.01 to use. Getting the STL to work
     in this older compilers really sucks! It will return. : Acidus
   - mod10 tool has been added. Will validate credit card numbers
     using the Luhn algorithm, and will generate valid numbers
     from a prefix. Used with bitgen to create valid bitstreams
     for Stripe Snoop users without hardware readers. : Acidus

   Cards Added

     Georgia Institute of Technology Buzzcard (Insecure) : Acidus
     Georgia Institute of Technology Buzzcard (Secure) : Acidus
     American Automobile Association Membership Card : Acidus
     Kroger Plus Card : Acidus

Version 1.2 (7-13-2004)

   - Added support for Linux and Unix-like systems! Must be run
     as root however, because of direct I/O requirements. : Acidus
   - Create track-generic parser, to extract fields from a
     decoded track, given a set of field delimiters. : Acidus
   - Luhn algorithm (AKA MOD10) implemented to detect proper
     credit card/debit card account numbers. : Acidus
   - Can detect Visa credit cards, displays account number,
     expiration date, and encrypted pin. : Acidus

Version 1.1 (7-2-2004)

   - Added support to compile as a DOS 16 bit application. : Acidus
   - Windows 9x, ME builds no longer depend on Inpout32.dll. : Acidus
   - Made syntax compatible for older C compilers, specifically
     Borland Turbo C 2.01. This might have been a bad idea! : Acidus
   - Timing loops no longer an issue! Ran fine on a 486DX2-66. : Acidus
   - Added comments, should be easier for others to hack on. : Acidus
 
   Bug Fixes
  
   - Memory leak when reversing bit stream fixed : Acidus

version 1.0 (6/26/2004)

   - Complete rewrite in C. Much more stable than 0.5. : Acidus
   - Command line interface. : Acidus
   - Implements LRC algorithm to detect bad cards. : Acidus
   - Auto-detects cards swiped backwards, reverses the
     bit stream and attempts decode again. : Acidus
   - Debugging information sent to stdout with "-v". : Acidus

version 0.5 (4/16/2004)

   - Written in Visual Basic 6.0. : Acidus
   - Pretty Gui. : Acidus
   - Dependent on Inpout32.dll for all I/O calls. : Acidus
   - Debugging info can be dumped to a file. : Acidus
